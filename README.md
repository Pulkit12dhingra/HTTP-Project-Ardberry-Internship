## How it Works

1. Firstly to run locally we need a python interpreter "https://www.python.org/downloads/" . Install the python interpreter and make sure to select the set path option while installing to automatically set the path of the python interpreter.

2. Next, clone the repo and extract the files to the C drive user defaults folder (or any other folder)
3. Now open the command prompt and go to the cloned folder using the cd command.
